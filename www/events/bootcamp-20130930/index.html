<h1>Chisel 2.0 Bootcamp</h1>
<p>
<b>Date:</b> September 30, 2013
</p><p>
<b>Location:</b> <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/3dmap/3dmap.shtml?sutardja">Sutardja Dai Hall</a>
</p>

<p>
The main objective of the Chisel bootcamp is to get groups started
using the <a href="http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu">Chisel</a>
hardware design infrastructure and to learn about the 2.0 version.
In the bootcamp, we will describe the language
features, and also how to generate fast C++ cycle simulations, Verilog
for FPGA emulation, and Verilog for ASIC synthesis.  Due to time and
licence issues, we will focus on the C++ simulator backend for the
workshop, though are happy to support groups who also want to
integrate the Verilog output into their hardware design flows.
