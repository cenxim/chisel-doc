<h1>Chisel Bootcamp</h1>
<p>
<b>Date:</b>June 8, 2012
</p><p>
<b>Location:</b> <a href="http://berkeley.edu/map/3dmap/3dmap.shtml?sutardja">Sutardja Dai Hall</a>
</p>

<p>
The main objective of the Chisel bootcamp is to get groups started
using the <a href="http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu">Chisel</a>
hardware design infrastructure, and also to get feedback on the Chisel
system features.  In the bootcamp, we will describe the language
features, and also how to generate fast C++ cycle simulations, Verilog
for FPGA emulation, and Verilog for ASIC synthesis.  Due to time and
licence issues, we will focus on the C++ simulator backend for the
workshop, though are happy to support groups who also want to
integrate the Verilog output into their hardware design flows.

<h3>Laptop preparation</h3>

We're assuming you'll use your laptop to run Chisel.

Chisel runs on either Linux systems or on Mac OS X 10.6 and newer.
Installation instructions will be sent out a week before bootcamp.
<!-- are <a href="">here</a>. -->
Please try to install before the workshop.
We will provide an Amazon EC2 instance running a Linux Chisel image
for those without Linux or Mac laptops.

<h3>Logistics</h3>

  San Francisco, then follow signs to 80E/Bay Bridge. After bridge,
  stay in left lanes and follow signs to Berkeley on 80.  Take
  University Ave exit, and head towards campus. </p>

<p><b>Public transit:</b> Take <a href="http://www.bart.gov">BART</a> from the airport, to the Downtown
  Berkeley station. </p>

<p><b>Parking:</b>We'll provide permit parking in lots across the
