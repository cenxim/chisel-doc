<p>Muxes of type Bits now use SInt (previously, UInt) This fixes issue
#358 and constitutes behavioral change. To facilitate any necessary
porting, a warning is now issued when a Mux of type Bits is
created. This warning will likely be turned off or removed in future
versions. Justification behind using SInt over UInt is so that
corresponding sign extension is better aligned to C semantics.
