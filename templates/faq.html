  <h2>Does Chisel convert Scala to Verilog?</h2>
  <p>No Chisel is a hardware construction language for writing Scala programs
    that generate hardware</p>

  <h2>What's the overhead for Chisel?</h2>
  <p>None. Chisel allows designers to write circuits structurally as they do
    in Verilog with no extra overhead.</p>

  <h2>Why do I need SBT to compile and execute my Chisel code?</h2>
  <p>
    Technically you don't.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a> is
    a builder for scala which is a cross between apt-get and make.
    It downloads all the prerequisites (as apt-get would do) then
    builds your chisel code (as make would do). The downloaded files
    will be cached in ~/.sbt and ~/.ivy2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chisel is packaged as a regular JAR file published on the sonatype
    repo. If you have your own build system, the bare minimum you need
    is to download the <a href="http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/edu/berkeley/cs/chisel_2.10/2.2.16/chisel_2.10-2.2.16.jar">latest chisel jar file</a>
    and execute the following commands (based on the example in the
    <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file).
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
# Compile and execute your Chisel code
$ scalac-2.10 -cp chisel_2.10-2.2.16.jar Hello.scala
$ scala-2.10 -cp chisel_2.10-2.2.16.jar:. hello

# Compile and run the generated simulation
$ g++ -std=c++11 -o HelloModule HelloModule.cpp HelloModule-emulator.cpp
$ ./HelloModule 1
  </pre>

  <h2>How can I make a vector of modules?</h2>
  <pre class="code">
Vec.fill{ Module(new CPU()).io }
  </pre>

  <h2>How do I get in touch with the Chisel community?</h2>
  <p>
There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chisel-users">Chisel users Google group</a>.
You can also search for Chisel on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chisel">Stack Overflow</a>.
To report bugs on the Chisel code itself,
please <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel/issues">open an issue on github</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How stable is Chisel?</h2>
  <p>
    Every night, we build all of Chisel and the projects listed
    in <a href="./download.html">download</a> with the help of
    a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">jenkins</a> buildbot.
    Follow the unit tests trends <a href="./unit_test_trends.html">here</a>.
