      <div class="page-header"><h1>About Chisel</h1></div>
      <p> Chisel is a new open-source hardware construction language
        developed at UC Berkeley that supports
        advanced hardware design using highly parameterized generators
        and layered domain-specific hardware languages.  Chisel is
        embedded in the Scala programming language, which raises the
        level of hardware design abstraction by providing concepts
        including object orientation, functional programming,
        parameterized types, and type inference.  Chisel can generate
        a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator, or
        low-level Verilog designed to pass on to standard ASIC or FPGA
        tools for synthesis and place and route.

We are currently transitioning to Chisel 2.0 which has simplified types and
supports multiple clock domains among other things.  Check out the updated docs
below.  Consult <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel/blob/master/ChangeLog">conversion document</a> for how to convert your code from 1.x to 2.0.
We will host a full day Chisel Bootcamp at Berkeley on Monday Sep 30th.
Stay tuned for a formal announcement of the 2.0 release and the accompanying
bootcamp.

      <p> Sodor, a set of educational processors written in Chisel is available as a <a href="https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-sodor">github repository</a>. Sodor implements the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture designed in the Berkeley EECS Berkeley Architecture Research (BAR) group and described on <a href="http://riscv.org">riscv.org</a>. Sodor is made available under
      a <a href="./BSD_licence.html">modified BSD Licence</a>.  Follow instructions in the README file.  Sodor was created by Christopher Celio, a PhD student at UC Berkeley.</p>
