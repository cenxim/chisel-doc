<p>
This release provides initial support for Scala 2.11.

In order to use the 2.11 version of the code, change the scalaVersion
definition in your build.sbt (or build.scala) file from
<pre><code>
scalaVersion := "2.10.x"
</code></pre>
to:
<pre><code>
scalaVersion := "2.11.4"
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Expect three warnings when compiling under Scala 2.11:
</p>
<pre><code>
[warn] src/main/scala/Parameters.scala:272: abstract type T in type pattern Chisel.Ex[T] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
[warn]           case ex:Ex[T] => _bindLet[T](pname,ex)
[warn]                   ^
[warn] src/main/scala/Parameters.scala:271: abstract type T in type pattern Chisel.Knob[T] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
[warn]           case k:Knob[T] => ExVar[T](_VarKnob[T](k.name))
[warn]                  ^
